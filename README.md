# Gobblet-Gobblers

In our C++ project, my team and I developed the game Gobblet Gobblers. I led a team of three people and coordinated the entire project. The project involved implementing the game rules, available at [link](https://themindcafe.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Gobblet-Gobblers.pdf). I worked on developing the "player vs computer" part of the game, including both hard and easy versions. Additionally, I created a "special mode" version of the game, adding a fun twist by starting with a specific set of pieces on the board. As the team leader, I managed task assignments, meeting scheduling, and communication with professors. I also created a demo video for the project, available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1onudVbT4Ufva-lF7iSEvAEefzxMV8e7A?usp=sharing).
Our professor was impressed with our work and published the project on his Facebook page, at [link](https://www.facebook.com/1375675193/videos/10219859942993744/) .

The code of the project will be part of the repo soon.
